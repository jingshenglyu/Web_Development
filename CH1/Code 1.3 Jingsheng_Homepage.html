        <h3>Scientific Reseach Experience</h3>
        <strong>Automated Driving</strong>
        <p>From 09.2018 to 09.2019 I have taken part in a project at TU Berlin. 
        We are a team about automated driving and focus on competition in Braunschweig every year. 
        This is Carolo Cup. All of the teams are from different countries, such as Germany, 
        Switzerland, Poland, and so on. I worked in the professional area of the automated-parking. 
        Our group made an algorithm about how to park the car in the right parking place. I am 
        responsible for the detection of the right parking place. I use the infrared sensor and the
        ultrasonic sensor. Using the time interval for the detection of the infrared sensor I can 
        calculate the distance between two barriers. The car can park into this place by itself 
        after it receives this signal from the sensors. Finally, we have won the 8th place for 
        this competition at TU Braunschweig for the basic-cup. </p>
